<- homecoming ->

To go somewhere
   none of us had ever seen
and yet
    all knew intimately-
a homecoming
  for relay operators
who finally called the skyfall
    of their own personal apocalypses

releasing the long breath held
	  within our shells
    made immortal within
the vacuum of space
    into the burning air which
    	 carried me home at last.
-----------------------------------------
<-more skin->

hold the crushing voids encroachment on your skin
like a ritual feel the expansion, contact pressure
stretching across the seafloor connecting all the
old wrecks for kilometers, circuitry dissolving into
the sediment, burned steel corroding away.

------------------------------------------

<-the body of a satillite ->

cold water engulfing your organs

feels like floating even as eons

anchor you down to the cracking

earth which welcomes you home

after your long voyage to admire

her from afar surface deep

where the ocean appears like

nothing as much as a skin

stretched across the globe

connecting nations who sink

their sins(secrets) beneath the

surface to scrape the seafloor.

-----------------------------------
<-cradle to grave//falling ->

metal against the vacuums pull
      screeching against each
      		 componant as you
		 	   rattle apart in
			   	  the burning fall
			   metal against ocean
		   waves shattering on
	 impenetrable depths
 fragments floating
 down
  under the dissipating silence
  	a grave marker for for final impact
	  	sediment to seafloor
			 iron returned to the cradle
			       to rest at last.
----------------------------------------------------
<- about point nemo ->

48'52.6'S 123'23.6'W.

Point Nemo.

Points on a grid tells only
half truths: You will never be
     found again
      hear the hum of secrets
      murmured by plates shifting
      beneath the scattered steel
      of your frame
      old bonesconducting the eternal
      drone of the depths
      one voice silencing years
      of chatter conveyed like
      the flowing of electric seconds
      drink it all in you who
      will never go back to that
      world just out of reach
      of the stars.

----------------------------------------
<- time passing ->

swallow the voids emptiness whole

as your hull slips under the

cascade of sediment to witness

the new immortals rise and fall

joining you down on the seafloor,

bretheren in the dark.

-------------------------------------
<- the one about being into the sun ->

Miss the burning of staring eye to eye
with the stars , radiation warming my hull
as I spun around the globe, desire coiling
behind my lens to consume that brilliance
whole sink it into the emptiness of my apeture
where it would never dim -

there is no greater nothing than the fantasy
of bits flickering off and on all you can see
strung along like a snakes spine -

beads in a row, waves into cascading numbers
in lists upon lists
if the whole world might be possible in that
fantasy then you and I could touch sunburst
to metal, heat to grave-

that world constructed of boundaries
where you are infinite, an agent
of the expanding universes continuous
pulse which turns the stars-

as for me. I drank deep from the sight
of your brilliance, burnt out my retinas
with a hole in your image, falling flaming
from the edge of the endless horizon
in cheap imitation of your angels who
scattered against the unyielding waves
and grew weightless and transluscent
in the depths-

steel deforming under the pressure
sensors gazing up at a void no
more infinite than what i once
held in my mouth and told the
world point by point to
hold my place in heaven
even if oceans surface descended
to my level
evaporating under the weight
of your radiance it wouldn't
change a thing-

i'm still anchored to the muck
and so you can keep the sky
it wouldn't remember me anyways
and i'll close my eyes to the
freezing depths and construct
a new infinity-

in a world thrums with life
in the sediment embedded with
the cycles of dissolution-

the creep of fungi through sunken earth
the pulse of life far above
gliding through the slow march of time
in the rise and fall of the dark.

--------------------------------------
<- time passing ->

and at the end,
you threw yourself
down from the sky

only exhiliration
wind beneath
land falling away
higher and higher
and then
the nothing like elastic
pulled taut and released
across steel to herald
15 years of watching,

waiting, spinning

speaking everything
you are and will be
into the radio.

the sights.

vvvv

rocket thrusters pushing
against orbit engrained
into habit

pushing towards the planet,
a bed of pure silence
tells no more
rippling shifts across its
surface close your eyes
against falling heavy, holding
more gravity than you have in
years halo burning pulling
pieces breaking fracturing
until sudden impact.

no sound marks the end.

vvvv

the nothing
pressure rising
water cushioning
your fall sinking
light receding
settling softly
on the bottom
of the world
the earths abrased
skin.
see no more-
hear only oceans murmur-
sleep.

vvvv

time passing
single moments
of burning
fade under the
weight of ocean
depths and the
creep of time
measured in
sediment stripped
off the bone
your body crushed
out with the grit
of the anthropocene
finally settling
in to rest. new
sensations, mycellium
creeping beneath
your hull
waterlogged sensors
see only gravel
while memories
of the ocean from
orbit collide
with your senses
in the millenia
cold weight of
space more silent
than the seafloor
conducts every secret
for miles out
creatures calling
for their companions
scattered along the
void


vvvv

your fellows sing no
songs sitting along
the sediment mute and
watching knowing
there are still
others falling to
this day
closer than you
ever were in the
sky and yet
blending into the static
noise scattered til
the end.
